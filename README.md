# CNN_DogvsCat_Prediction_miniProject
In this mini project I have used CNN to predict whether the given image is Dog or Cat.
I have used 2 models, first with two Convolutional Layers and second with three Convolutional Layers.
In first model the differnce between train acc and validation acc was high so the model was overfitting. 
In the 2nd model and extra Convolutiional layer helped a lot dealing with overfitting. 
You can also try increasing image resolution to achieve better accuracy.
